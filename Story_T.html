  <p style="font-size: 27px; position: absolute; top: 120; left: 50; z-index: 1;">La-la-la, la la, la-la-la, thanks for letting me sing with you! In return, I want to tell you a story...</p>
    <p style="font-size: 27px; position: absolute; top: 190; left: 70; z-index: 1;">I used to be made fun of for sounding different from the other Tadpoles. <br> I was ostracised but still wanted to be accepted so I hung around the other tadpoles. One day I noticed these snakes slithering around the area and alerted the other tadpoles with my unique voice. That day I gained many friends and learned to accept my unique voice. </p>
    <p style="font-size: 27px; position: absolute; top: 370; left: 50; z-index: 1;">I love singing so let me sing you the next clue to find Eel:
<br>A lazy eel is fast asleep by the building that connects,
<br>By the doors there are some stairs, go down it’s not complex,
<br>A little red house it hides itself in, 
<br>But what is not hidden is its tail fin. </p>
